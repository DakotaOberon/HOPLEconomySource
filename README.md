<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

There are many economy bots for Discord, yet they are usually tacked onto another bot and lack many features people want from an economy bot. HOPLEconomySource aims to be the foundation you need to set up your own economy bot quickly and easily on your server. This project is built with modding in mind, along with the open-source nature of this project, I am confident that it will be the foundation for many amazing economy bots on Discord.

HOPLEconomySource comes as a rewrite to my own economy bot I made for a small private server of mine. My hope is that I will eventually move my own bot over to HOPLEconomySource as I build-up its features.

This is HOPLEconomySource, a foundation for quickly and easily setting up your own economy bot for your Discord server. While there are many economy bots out there, they are often missing comprehensive features that users desire and are often tacked onto other bots with limited customization options. Our goal with HOPLEconomySource is to provide a solution for both Discord servers and developers.

HOPLEconomySource is built with modding in mind, allowing users to customize and extend its functionality for the unique needs of their server. Whether you want new commands, integration with other bots on your server, or adjust the economy mechanics to your liking, this project aims to provide flexibility and modularity. The open-source nature of HOPLEconomySource empowers developers to share their own mods with the community.

I'm confident that HOPLEconomySource will be the foundation for many amazing economy bots on Discord.

*I had initially built this project from an economy bot I built for a small private server. My aim is to migrate the features over to this project, with expandability in mind. Some of the features I had developed for the other bot were server stores, games & gambling, income through voice and text, weekly news, and stats commands. I had more plans for additional features but I want to eventually migrate my bot over to this so I can continue its development on a more solid foundation.*
